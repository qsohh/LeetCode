## Validate Stack Sequences

```python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        p_poped = 0
        stack = []
        for ele in pushed:
            stack.append(ele)
            while stack and popped[p_poped] == stack[-1]:
                p_poped += 1
                stack.pop()
        return not bool(stack)
```
